            <h1>This is for handling IRL movement for VR. It solves "playspace cheating"</h1>

            <p>
                This script handles roomspace player movement and is completely independent from controller based movement. It doesn’t rely on rigid bodies, or a character controller. 
                Instead, it uses its own physics casts, to detect collision and move the XR rig to keep the player outside of in-game objects including floors and ceiling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step is to create an XR Rig. 
            </p>
            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/create xr rig.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                then put the rig in an empty game object named player. 
            </p>
            <div class="holder">

            </div>
            <p>
                this player object is where this new script will go as well as any other movement scripts.
            </p>
            <h3>Here I'm going to explain the main parts of the script. The full script will be at the bottom of the page.</h2>
            <p> 
                the first thing we need to do is move the XRRig when the players head collides with in-game objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                to do this we need to define a few variables:
                <br>• the XRRigs transform
                <br>• the cameras transform
                <br>• a physics layer mask for the collsions
                <br>• and a radius of the player for the physics casts
                <br>• also we need to store the cameras previous postion
            </p>

            <p>
                in the update function we need to calculate the direction in which the main camera has moved since the last update by subtracting the previous camera position from the current camera position.
                <br>then perform a SphereCast in the direction of camera movement, starting from the previous camera position.
            </p>
            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/head cast.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                to move the XRRig we need a few functions:
            </p>
            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/move rig on hits functions.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                <br>The hits from the SphereCast are passed to the MoveRigOnHit function.
            </p>
            <p>
                MoveRigOnHit(RaycastHit[] hits) Function:
                <br>This function is responsible for moving the rig based on the collision information received.
                <br>If there are any hits detected, it calculates the average normal of the collision points and the total distance to move.
                <br>It then moves the xrOriginTransform in the opposite direction of the average normal multiplied by the total distance to move.
            </p>
            <p>
                GetAverageNormal(RaycastHit[] hits) Function:
                <br>This function calculates the average normal vector from an array of RaycastHit objects.
                <br>It iterates through each hit, summing up the normal vectors.
                <br>Finally, it divides the sum by the number of hits to get the average normal vector.
            </p>
            <p>
                GetDistanceToMove(RaycastHit[] hits) Function:
                <br>This function calculates the total distance to move based on the hit information.
                <br>It iterates through each hit, summing up the distances.
                <br>Finally, it subtracts the product of the number of hits and the sphere's radius to get the total distance.
            </p>

            <p>this is all fine if you only collide with walls but if you collide with the ground or a ceiling you rig will move vertically and ground in your game will no longer line up with the ground in real life.
                to resolve this we need to move the rig vertically back into it correct position after colliding.
            </p>
            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/return rig vertically.png">
            </div>

            <p>in here we make use of our projected positions that we use for our casts. 
                one is just right above the standingPostion at camera level, and the other is the camera postion at this objects level.</p>

            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/projected positions.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                in HandleUpdatingStandingPositionAndDetectingLean() we do a capsule cast from our last standingPositon and our current projectedCameraPositionDown.
                if there is no collision we updated standingPositon to the projectedCameraPositionDown.
                if it doesnt collide then we calculate a new standing positon along the edge of the collider.
            </p>
            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/update standing pos.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                the second cast so to make sure there is no colliders inbetween your last and new standing position and then finally updates the standing position and sets leaning to true.
            </p>
            <p>
                if we are leaning then we do leaning collision pushback, its similar to the push back for head collisions but we use a capsule collider instead of sphere collider. 
                the capsule goes from above the standing positon to the head and allow for collision detection on things like window seals if leaning out a window.
            </p>
            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/lean pushback.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                also while leaning we need to handle pushback for in the player leans too far from their standing position.
                in HandleOverLeanDistancePushback() we handle it dynamicly use a cast downward to see the height of the thing youre leaning over. 
                that way the lean distance allow changed depending on how much space you have above it.
            </p>
            <div class="holder">
                <img src="./assets/dynamic lean distance.png">

            <p>
                Below is the full script.  
                In the inspector, you assign the cameraTrasnform as the main camera object in the XRRig,
                the xrRigTransform as the XRRig,
                and the layer mask as the physics layers that you want the collisions detected on.
            </p>
